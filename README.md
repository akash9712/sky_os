### README

Writing a basic OS for my own understanding. There are two goals I'm trying to achieve here:
- Get an understanding of how basic OS features like memory management, virtual memory, process isolation etc. work. Stretch goals include implementing multi-threading.
- Implement my own basic C/C++ libraries. Understanding the bare bones implementation of these languages will help get a better understanding of how high level features work.


Using https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial as a reference. The tutorial is written in NASM syntax. I'm going to be writing this in GNU assembler syntax, just to make sure that I don't blindly copy the code and actually understand what I'm doing.

This is not aimed at implementing novel features for an operating system, but rather to understand how basic OS'es work and develop a solid understanding of fundamentals of C/C++.
