### README

Writing a basic OS for my own understanding. There are two goals I'm trying to achieve here:
- Get an understanding of how basic OS features like memory management, virtual memory, process isolation etc. work. Stretch goals include implementing multi-threading.
- Implement my own basic C/C++ libraries. Understanding the bare bones implementation of these languages will help get a better understanding of how high level features work.


- Using Writing a *Simple Operating System from Scratch* by Nick Blundell as a reference. The book mainly uses NASM syntax, I'm writing this OS in GAS syntax to avoid blindly copying pieces of code, and since it is supposed to better integrate with the Linux toolchains 
- Referencing osdev.com throughout the process.

This is not aimed at implementing novel features for an operating system, but rather to understand how basic OS'es work and develop a solid understanding of fundamentals of C/C++.
